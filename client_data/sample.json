it was only yesterday I woke up from another restless sleep and after staring at my social media account for an hour I headed downstairs That day felt different It was harder to move my stomach hurt and a wave of sickness washed over me Then out of nowhere tears began to stream down my face and the air failed to leave my lungs As I fell to the floor in a broken mess my mum flew in from out of nowhere With a concerned look on her face that look which only a mother can have she held me and asked a simple question are you ok In that moment those words which I m certain I d heard before felt like the warmest of hugs and I uttered the words I want to die I felt ashamed Before I knew it I was sat in the doctor s office discussing my thoughts and feelings not something I was particularly comfortable with at the time So what if I was depressed That s fine right The doctor would give me some medication and then I d be back to my normal self I had to admit I never thought I d suffer from depression After all I m strong willed and the people who suffer from depression are weak right Another shameful moment of my inexperienced mind My friends and family played a huge role in my recovery a group of people who were loving kind and understanding If it wasn t for those people I wouldn t be here today ", "username": "sample"}, {"date": "02/17/20 00:20:58", "prediction": "1", "text":
